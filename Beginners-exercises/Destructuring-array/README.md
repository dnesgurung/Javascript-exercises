You decide to break the feedback into three groups: positive (7-10), negative (0-3) or neutral (4-6).

The function gatherFeedback takes an array of arrays, each of these arrays contains both a string of the name of the attendee and a number showing how they rated the party out of 10.

It should return an object with three properties: a key of positive with a value of the number of positive reviews; a key of negative with a value of the number of negative reviews; and, a key of neutral with a value of the number of neutral reviews.
