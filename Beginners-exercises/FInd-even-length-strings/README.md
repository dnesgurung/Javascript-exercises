Create a function that will take an array of values and should return an array of all the even length strings.

Anything that's not a string or not a string of even length should not be returned in the array.

If there are no even length strings, it should return an empty array.

Examples:

findEvenLengthStrings(['hi', 'bye'])
// returns ['hi']
