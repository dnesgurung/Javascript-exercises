The orderSupplies function takes two arguments: a supplies object with keys of party supplies and values of the cost of that supply,
and the number of guests attending.

It should return a number showing the total cost of ordering one of each item per guest!

orderSupplies({ cake: 2, iceCream: 7 }, 2);
// should return 18

orderSupplies({ plates: 2, cups: 1, forks: 1, partyHats: 4 }, 20);
// should return 160
