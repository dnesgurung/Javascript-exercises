You have been asked to write a function which will select the winners based on two factors: how much they paid, and their seat number. If both of these numbers are odd, the attendee wins a prize!

The pickWinners function will be passed an array of numbers representing ticket costs as its only argument. The index position represents the seat number.

Your task is to return an array of objects. Each object should contain two keys. The first key is seat with a value of the odd index. The second key is ticketCost with a value of the ticket price at that index in the input array.
