Journeys up to 3 minutes long have a flat base rate cost of Â£5
Every minute after the first 3 will cost an extra 70p
The length of the journey is always rounded up to a whole number of minutes
The calculateTaxiFare function should take a number representing the length of a taxi journey in seconds, and return a number representing the cost of that journey in pence.

calculateTaxiFare(150);
// should return 500

calculateTaxiFare(360);
// should return 710

calculateTaxiFare(491);
// should return 920
